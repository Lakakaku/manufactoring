# FactoryKnowledge Project Overview

## Vision
FactoryKnowledge is a mobile-first video knowledge management platform designed specifically for manufacturing facilities. It enables factory workers to document machine operations through video, creating a searchable, offline-accessible knowledge base directly on the factory floor.

## Core Problem
Manufacturing facilities struggle with knowledge transfer, especially when experienced workers retire or when new equipment is introduced. Traditional documentation is often outdated, text-heavy, and inaccessible on the factory floor.

## Solution
A mobile app that allows workers to:
- Record video documentation of machine operations
- Add searchable metadata and tags
- Access content offline
- Share knowledge across shifts and departments
- Build a comprehensive video library of institutional knowledge

## Key Users
1. **Factory Workers**: Primary content creators and consumers
2. **Knowledge Champions**: Approve and curate content
3. **Factory Admins**: Manage system and users
4. **Shift Supervisors**: Ensure knowledge capture

## Business Model
- SaaS subscription based on number of users
- Tiered pricing for different factory sizes
- Enterprise features for multi-facility organizations

## Development Status
Project is in initial setup phase. Core infrastructure is being established with a focus on:
- Monorepo structure setup
- Database schema design
- Authentication flow implementation
- Video processing pipeline architecture
