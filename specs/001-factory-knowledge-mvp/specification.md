## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Factory workers need to document machine operation procedures through video to create a searchable knowledge base that new employees can access to learn proper procedures, even when offline on the factory floor. Factory managers need visibility into documentation coverage and worker training progress.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Factory Setup
1. **Given** a new factory manager signs up, **When** they complete registration, **Then** they receive a unique Factory Join Code for their workers
2. **Given** a factory manager has an account, **When** they configure departments, **Then** workers can be assigned to specific departments with filtered content access

#### Worker Onboarding
3. **Given** a worker has the Factory Join Code, **When** they enter it in the mobile app, **Then** they gain access to their factory's knowledge base
4. **Given** a new worker joins a department, **When** they open the app, **Then** relevant procedures for their department auto-download for offline access

#### Machine Documentation
5. **Given** a worker discovers an undocumented machine, **When** they add it via the app, **Then** it appears in the documentation queue and notifies admins
6. **Given** a machine needs documentation, **When** a worker records a procedure video, **Then** they can enhance it with text overlays and safety warnings

#### Knowledge Access
7. **Given** a worker needs to operate a machine, **When** they search for it (even with typos), **Then** they find relevant procedures ranked by relevance
8. **Given** a worker is offline, **When** they access procedures for their department, **Then** all content is available from local storage

#### Quality Control
9. **Given** a worker submits a procedure video, **When** a knowledge champion reviews it, **Then** they can approve, reject, or request revisions with specific feedback
10. **Given** a procedure is approved, **When** workers in that department open the app, **Then** the new procedure syncs automatically

#### Analytics & Compliance
11. **Given** a manager needs documentation coverage data, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they see percentage of machines documented and gaps
12. **Given** audit requirements, **When** generating compliance reports, **Then** system produces ISO 9001 compliant documentation with full audit trails

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a worker loses network connection mid-upload? (Queue for later sync)
- How does system handle duplicate machine additions? (Flag for admin review/merge)
- What if video exceeds 10-minute limit? (Prompt to split into multiple procedures)
- How are outdated procedures handled? (Version history with review cycles)
